Python applications

In the **Banking Application**, I developed a terminal-based banking system in Python that simulates essential banking transactions. The program provides an interactive interface where customers can check their account balance, withdraw money, or deposit funds. The application is built around a central dictionary data structure that holds customer information, including a Personal Identification Number (PIN), name, number of incorrect login attempts, account status, and account balance.

**Key Features:**
 - **Secure PIN-based Authentication**: Customers are prompted to enter their account number and a 4-digit PIN. The program verifies this against pre-stored data and allows a maximum of three incorrect PIN attempts before locking the account.

 - **Dynamic Menu Interface**: Upon successful authentication, the system displays a menu offering various transaction options: balance check, withdrawal, and deposit.

 - **Real-time Transaction Updates**: Account balances are updated in real-time following a transaction, and users are informed of their new balance.

 - **Input Validation**: Implemented thorough input validation to ensure that only valid numerical inputs are accepted for account numbers, PINs, and transaction amounts. Invalid or inappropriate inputs are caught and the user is prompted to try again.

 - **Decimal Formatting**: All monetary amounts are displayed with two decimal places for easier readability and financial accuracy.

 - **Error Handling**: Utilized Python's try-except blocks for robust error handling to make the application more fault-tolerant.

This project enhanced my skills in Python programming, data structure manipulation, and implementing user-friendly interfaces. It also provided me with valuable experience in implementing security features and input validation in a banking system.
